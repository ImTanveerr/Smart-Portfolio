# Smart Portfolio — Project Plan

A personal portfolio site for a software engineer, featuring a projects showcase, a tech blog,
and an admin-only panel to manage both — built with Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript.

> Edit this file freely. Once you're happy with it, tell me to proceed and I'll execute it phase by phase.

> **Working style:** built and reviewed one phase at a time — each phase is implemented, then paused for you to check before the next one starts.

> **Next.js 16 note:** the scaffolded app uses Next.js 16, which has real breaking changes vs. older tutorials/docs: `middleware.ts` is renamed to `proxy.ts` (exported function is `proxy`, not `middleware`), `params`/`searchParams` are async everywhere (`await params`), and Turbopack is the default bundler. This plan already accounts for those.

---

## 1. Goals

- Public-facing site to showcase software projects (with overview, tech stack, links).
- A blog to write about tech topics.
- A private admin area (login-gated) to create/edit/delete/publish both projects and blog posts —
  no code changes or redeploys needed to publish content.
- Clean, fast, SEO-friendly, responsive, works well as a professional portfolio to share with employers/recruiters.

## 2. Tech Stack

| Concern            | Choice                                             | Why |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----|
| Framework           | Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript                | Requested; SSR/SSG for SEO, Server Actions for CRUD without hand-rolled API layer |
| Database            | PostgreSQL, hosted on Supabase                       | Relational data (posts/projects/tags) fits SQL well; free hosted tier; pairs cleanly with Vercel |
| ORM                 | Prisma                                               | End-to-end type safety with TypeScript, easy migrations |
| Auth                | NextAuth v4 (`next-auth`), Credentials provider      | v5/Auth.js is still beta on npm as of build time; v4 is stable, mature, and fully supports the App Router |
| Styling             | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui                             | Fast, accessible components for admin CRUD screens (tables, forms, dialogs) and public site |
| Content editor      | `@uiw/react-md-editor` (Markdown + live preview)     | Content stored as Markdown text; simple, great for code snippets in blog posts |
| Content rendering    | `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` + syntax highlighting | Render stored Markdown on the public site |
| Forms/validation    | `react-hook-form` + `zod`                            | Shared validation schema between client forms and server actions |
| Deployment          | Vercel (app) + Supabase (DB)                         | Standard, zero-config Next.js hosting; free tiers for a personal site |

## 3. Data Model (Prisma)

```prisma
model User {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  email     String   @unique
  password  String   // bcrypt hash
  name      String?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}

model Post {
  id          String    @id @default(cuid())
  title       String
  slug        String    @unique
  excerpt     String?
  content     String    // Markdown (Postgres String already maps to `text`, no @db.Text needed)
  coverImage  String?
  published   Boolean   @default(false)
  publishedAt DateTime?
  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime  @updatedAt
  tags        Tag[]     @relation("PostTags")
}

model Project {
  id          String    @id @default(cuid())
  title       String
  slug        String    @unique
  summary     String
  description String    // Markdown
  coverImage  String?
  repoUrl     String?
  liveUrl     String?
  featured    Boolean   @default(false)
  order       Int       @default(0)
  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime  @updatedAt
  techStack   Tag[]     @relation("ProjectTech")
}

model Tag {
  id       String    @id @default(cuid())
  name     String    @unique
  slug     String    @unique
  posts    Post[]    @relation("PostTags")
  projects Project[] @relation("ProjectTech")
}

model Profile {
  id           String   @id @default("profile")
  name         String?
  title        String?
  description  String?
  aboutContent String?
  email        String?
  phone        String?
  avatarImage  String?
  githubUrl    String?
  linkedinUrl  String?
  twitterUrl   String?
  websiteUrl   String?
  updatedAt    DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

`Tag` is shared between posts (topics) and projects (tech stack) to keep the model simple.

`Profile` is a **singleton** — always looked up/upserted by the fixed id `"profile"`
(`src/lib/profile.ts` exports `PROFILE_ID` and a `getProfile()` helper the admin page and every
public page that needs it uses). It backs the admin Profile section (`/admin/profile`), the home
page hero (avatar, name, title, description, email, phone, social links), **and** the About
content (`aboutContent`, edited via the same markdown editor used for post/project bodies) —
shown both in a dedicated `#about` section on the home page and on the standalone `/about` page,
which reads the same field so there's a single source of truth rather than two places to edit.
Every field is optional — public pages fall back to generic placeholder copy until filled in, so
nothing looks broken before the admin sets it.

---

## 4. Routes / Pages

**Public** — the navbar links to `/#projects`, `/#blog`, `/#about` (landing-page style: scroll to
the section on the home page, navigating to `/` first if you're elsewhere) rather than to
`/projects`, `/blog`, `/about` directly. Each home section still has a "View all" link to the
full standalone page for `/projects` and `/blog`; `/about` itself still exists as a directly
linkable URL (e.g. for a resume) showing the same `aboutContent`.
- `/` — home: hero, featured projects (`#projects`), latest posts (`#blog`), about (`#about`)
- `/projects` — grid of all projects, filterable by tag
- `/projects/[slug]` — project detail (overview, tech stack, links, screenshots)
- `/blog` — list of published posts, filterable by tag, paginated
- `/blog/[slug]` — post detail (rendered Markdown)
- `/about` — renders `Profile.aboutContent` (same content as the home page's About section)

**Admin** (all guarded except `/admin/login`)
- `/admin/login` — credentials login form
- `/admin` — dashboard (counts, quick links, recently edited items)
- `/admin/posts` — table of all posts (published/draft), search
- `/admin/posts/new`, `/admin/posts/[id]/edit`
- `/admin/projects` — table of all projects
- `/admin/projects/new`, `/admin/projects/[id]/edit`
- `/admin/profile` — single edit form for the home page hero profile (singleton, no list/new/delete)

Note: a standalone `/admin/tags` page was never built — tags/tech-stack turned out fine as a
plain comma-separated input on the post/project forms (upserted server-side), so a dedicated
management screen wasn't needed.

---

## 5. Auth Flow

- Single admin account, seeded via a `prisma/seed.ts` script from `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env vars (password hashed with bcrypt before storing).
- NextAuth Credentials provider (`src/lib/auth.ts`) checks email/password against the `User` table via Prisma + bcrypt compare.
- JWT session strategy (no DB session table needed — simpler for serverless deploys). `session.user.id` / `token.id` typed via `src/types/next-auth.d.ts` module augmentation.
- `src/proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 renamed `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts`) wraps `next-auth/middleware`'s `withAuth`, matching `/admin` and `/admin/((?!login).*)` — i.e. everything under `/admin` except `/admin/login`.
- `/admin/login` sits directly under `src/app/admin/`, while the guarded dashboard lives in a `src/app/admin/(dashboard)/` route group so its `layout.tsx` can do a server-side `getServerSession` check (defense-in-depth per Next.js 16's guidance that Proxy alone isn't enough for Server Actions) without redirect-looping against the login page itself.

## 7. CRUD Approach

- Use **Next.js Server Actions** (not a separate REST API) for all admin mutations — colocated with forms, fully typed, no extra API boilerplate.
- Each form (post/project) uses `react-hook-form` + a shared `zod` schema for client validation, and the server action re-validates the same schema before writing to the DB (never trust client input).
- Public pages fetch published content directly via Prisma in Server Components (no client-side fetching needed for content).

---

## 8. Images

- Cover images can be a pasted URL, or uploaded directly — `ImageUploadField`
  (`src/components/admin/image-upload-field.tsx`) offers both: a URL text input and an "Upload"
  button, side by side, with a live preview.
- File uploads go through `POST /api/upload` (`src/app/api/upload/route.ts`), which checks the
  admin session, validates the file is an image under 4MB, and uploads it to **Cloudinary**
  (`src/lib/cloudinary.ts`) via `upload_stream` — no local disk involved at any point.
  - **Not `multer` + local disk:** the app is deployed on Vercel, where the filesystem is
    read-only at runtime except `/tmp` (wiped after each request, not shared across instances) —
    a traditional `multer.diskStorage` write would silently vanish in production. Next.js Route
    Handlers also use the Web-standard `Request`/`FormData` API rather than Express's `req`/`res`,
    so `multer` (Express-specific middleware) isn't a natural fit here regardless; `request.formData()`
    already parses `multipart/form-data` without it.
  - Uploads are organized into Cloudinary folders `portfolio/projects` and `portfolio/posts`.
- Since cover image URLs can point to any external host, render them with a plain `<img>` tag rather than `next/image` (which requires each domain to be allow-listed in `images.remotePatterns` ahead of time) — avoids needing to update config every time a new image host is used.

---

## 9. SEO & Polish

- `generateMetadata` per page (title/description), dynamic OG data (title/description/image) on
  `/projects/[slug]` and `/blog/[slug]` via `generateMetadata`. `metadataBase` set from
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` so relative OG image paths resolve to absolute URLs.
- `sitemap.ts` (home, static pages, every project, every published post) and `robots.ts`
  (disallows `/admin`) for crawlability. `/admin/*` also carries `robots: { index: false }` via
  `src/app/admin/layout.tsx` as a second layer (belt-and-suspenders against accidental indexing).
- Tag-based filtering on `/blog` and `/projects` via `?tag=slug` (built in Phase 6).
- **shadcn/ui retrofit:** Phases 4–6 were built with plain Tailwind + native HTML elements, which
  deviated from this plan's original choice. Phase 7 retrofitted the admin forms (Input, Label,
  Textarea, Switch via `Controller` since it's not a native input), tables (Table, Badge), delete
  confirmation (AlertDialog replacing `window.confirm`), buttons (Button, including its `render`
  prop for polymorphic Link-as-Button), and the login page (Card) — plus swept the public site's
  raw `black/10 dark:white/10`-style classes over to the shadcn design tokens (`border-border`,
  `text-muted-foreground`, etc.) for one consistent design system.
  - shadcn's CLI (v4.x) defaulted to **Base UI** as the primitive/headless component library
    (its own recommended default) rather than Radix — a newer option than what older shadcn
    docs/tutorials describe. `components.json` records `"style": "base-nova"`.
  - `@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *));` in `globals.css` (written by shadcn's init) switches
    Tailwind's `dark:` variant from OS-preference-only to class-based, which `next-themes` toggles.
- **Dark mode:** `next-themes` (`src/components/theme-provider.tsx`, wired into the root layout
  with `attribute="class" defaultTheme="system" enableSystem`) + a `ThemeToggle` button (sun/moon
  icons from `lucide-react`) in both the public navbar and the admin header.
- Responsive layout: constrained `max-w-3xl` content column, flex/grid utility classes throughout.

## 10. Environment Variables

```
DATABASE_URL=          # Supabase transaction-mode pooler (port 6543) — app runtime, via driver adapter
DIRECT_URL=            # Supabase session-mode pooler (port 5432) — Prisma CLI migrations only
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=       # random secret for session signing
NEXTAUTH_URL=          # http://localhost:3000 in dev
ADMIN_EMAIL=           # used only by the seed script
ADMIN_PASSWORD=        # used only by the seed script (hashed before storing)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=  # base URL for sitemap/OG absolute URLs — update at deploy time (Phase 8)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME= # Cloudinary dashboard homepage
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=    # Cloudinary dashboard homepage
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET= # Cloudinary dashboard homepage — also needs adding on Vercel to deploy
```

**Getting these from Supabase:** dashboard → "Connect" → ORM tab → Prisma. Use the **pooler** URLs, not
the direct connection — Supabase's direct connection is IPv6-only and unreachable from many networks/ISPs.

**Prisma 7 note:** the version installed (7.8.0) is a newer major version with real API changes vs. older
Prisma docs/tutorials:
- The new default client generator (`provider = "prisma-client"`) outputs real `.ts` source to
  `src/generated/prisma` (gitignored, regenerated via `prisma generate`) instead of a binary in `node_modules`.
- Connection URLs are no longer declared in `schema.prisma`. `prisma.config.ts` holds the URL the **CLI**
  uses for migrate/generate (set to `DIRECT_URL`, the session pooler). The **app** connects independently
  at runtime via an explicit driver adapter (`@prisma/adapter-pg` + `pg`) constructed with `DATABASE_URL`
  (the transaction pooler) — see `src/lib/prisma.ts`.
- `directUrl` as a `schema.prisma` datasource field was removed entirely in v7; the split above is how the
  same two-URL Supabase setup is achieved instead.

## 11. Build Phases

1. **Scaffold** — `create-next-app` (TS, Tailwind, App Router, ESLint), git init, base folder structure.
2. **Database** — Prisma init, schema above, migration, seed script for the admin user.
3. **Auth** — NextAuth credentials config, login page, middleware guard, admin layout shell.
4. **Admin: Projects CRUD** — list table, create/edit forms with Markdown editor, delete, tag assignment.
5. **Admin: Blog CRUD** — list table, create/edit forms, publish/draft toggle, tag assignment.
6. **Public site** — home, projects list/detail, blog list/detail, about page.
7. **Polish** — SEO metadata, sitemap/robots, tag filtering, dark mode, responsive pass.
8. **Deploy** — push to GitHub, connect to Vercel, set env vars, run production migration.

## 12. Open Items / Things to Confirm Later

- Real name/title/bio/contact/social info — now editable at `/admin/profile` rather than requiring
  a code change, but still needs to actually be filled in with your real information.
- Footer branding (still says generic "Portfolio").
- Whether you want a contact form or just links (email/GitHub/LinkedIn).
- Domain name for deployment (optional).
- Whether Phase 2 image upload is worth adding, or URL-paste is fine long-term.
